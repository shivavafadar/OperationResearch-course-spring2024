This was the bachelors degree course from University of Tehran's College of Engineering


*Phase1*: 
project goal: modeling of practical problems, three-dimensional representation of feasible space (feasible set)
Problem statement:
A company manufacturing detergents and hygiene products has started working. Currently, this company produces three popular products: hair dryers, hand washing products and laundry products. The production cost of each ton of toothpaste is 130, each ton of detergent is 270 and each ton of laundry detergent is 310 million tomans. Sales revenue per
250 per ton of cloth, 460 ton for washing hands and 550 tomans for each ton of clothes.
given some constrains, we implemented : 
+ Model the problem for a period of time.
+ Specify the release clause, the objective statement, and the limitations.
+ The adverbs of the problem create a Polyhedron. Draw a few angles and show them from opposite angles
give
+ Does the problem have additional adverbs? Show them and avoid drawing them in Polyhedron
To have a unified form.

*Phase2*:
project goal: Simplex table, the movement of any point on the three-dimensional representation of feasible space (feasible set)
problem statement: According to the free term, the target expression and the adverbs that you defined in the previous phase, you displayed a multifaceted problem for the feasible space and calculated its optimal solution using ready-made functions.
In this phase, you have to do the simplex solution of the problem. Note that the use of ready-made functions is not allowed in this phase and you must enter the code of each simplex table and report the resulting point.
implemented:
+ Write each simplex table with code from scratch and report the resulting point and the value of the target in each iteration.
+ Display the points obtained in each step on the polygon of the space. - Display the direction of movement on the adjustable space to reach the optimal point. Report the value of step size
+ Finally, you should show the simplex table, the direction and step of the movement, and the points on the three-dimensional space.
